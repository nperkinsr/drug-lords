# Drug Lords
**Drug Lords** is a modern UI remake inspired by the classic text-based game Dope Wars from my childhood. This version adds a clean, intuitive interface featuring a city map to travel between locations, a bank system to save your money, and custom icons for drugs, money, and places — all designed from scratch.

Players buy and sell various drugs at fluctuating daily prices, aiming to buy low and sell high while managing risk — including the ever-present threat of getting caught by the cops. The interface displays your current cash in hand, and each drug is represented with its own icon to enhance immersion.

Though the core price changes are currently random, I’m working on implementing dynamic events (like university exams) that will influence prices, adding strategic depth. For example, having Adderall to sell near campus during exams can be very lucrative.

This project was built to practise UI design, dynamic pricing algorithms, game logic, and user interaction — with a personal touch and nostalgic homage to the original classic.
